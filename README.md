# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Deliverable 3: Employee database analysis



##Overview
As an increasing number of Pewlett-Hackard employees are reaching retirement age, there is concern that valuable institutional knowledge may be lost and key roles may become vacant 
if we don't act premptively to preserve the integrity of knowledge and prepare to fulfill employment gaps. This analysis is designed to determine the number of retiring 
employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

##Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

##Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

1) How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
2) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
